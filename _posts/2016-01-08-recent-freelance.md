Recently, I’ve been working with a few different podcasts to develop their brand & identity.
**Spirits** is a history and comedy podcast about mythology, folklore, and urban legends with over *1 Million downloads*. In every episode Julia, a historian and religious studies expert, teaches her childhood best friend Amanda about a different story from somewhere in the world. Featured in publications like *Wired, Buzzfeed, and the A.V. Club*, Spirits has been named a Best Podcast of 2017, Best Mythology Podcast, and Best Podcast for Curious Minds.

**Join the Party** is a collaborative storytelling and roleplaying podcast. That means four friends create a story together, chapter by chapter, that everyone from seasoned players to true beginners can enjoy. Within the first month of release, they were recommended in the A.V. club’s Podmass. More on my Join the Party process below.

<h4>The challenge:</h4>
A lot of genre’s in podcasting are over-saturated, so the importance of a tight and dynamic identity is even more key. The challenge was to avoid imagery that feels overly geeky and masculine, as well as cartoon imagery, which is very common in the genre.
