Recently, I’ve been working with a few different podcasts to develop their brand & identity.

**Women of Marvel** is a podcast within the Marvel Universe showcasing how people of all backgrounds are making a powerful and positive impact on our stories. They wanted a powerful brand refresh from their outdated that accurately represented their message and stood out in their genre.

**Spirits** is a history and comedy podcast about mythology, folklore, and urban legends with over *1 Million downloads*. In every episode Julia, a historian and religious studies expert, teaches her childhood best friend Amanda about a different story from somewhere in the world. Featured in publications like *Wired, Buzzfeed, and the A.V. Club*, Spirits has been named a Best Podcast of 2017, Best Mythology Podcast, and Best Podcast for Curious Minds.

**Join the Party** is a collaborative storytelling and roleplaying podcast. That means four friends create a story together, chapter by chapter, that everyone from seasoned players to true beginners can enjoy. Within the first month of release, they were recommended in the A.V. club’s Podmass.
