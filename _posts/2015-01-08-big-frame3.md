Since 2013, I've been working with and as talent at [Big Frame](http://www.bigfra.me/ "Big Frame"), a multi-channel YouTube network in Los Angeles. Youtube has been a huge part of my life since 2007, which I talk about a little more [here](https://allysonkate.github.io/word/2015/10/05/youtube%203/ "What Youtube Means to Me"). In 2013 I signed with Big Frame for two years as a content creator, producing videos on my personal channel in conjunction with a all-female vertical network initiative. As it became clearer to me that I didn't want to pursue YouTube as a career, I began fostering a design freelance relationship with Big Frame (now owned by DreamWorks/AwesomenessTV), which has now grown beyond my contract as talent.

A few of the YouTubers I've worked with include:

* Sarah Penna _(Big Frame co-founder, now with AwesomenessTV)_
* Joe Penna _([MysteryGuitarMan](https://www.youtube.com/user/MysteryGuitarMan "MysteryGuitarMan") &#x2192; 2.85 mil)_
* Jimmy Tatro _([LifeAccordingToJimmy](https://www.youtube.com/user/lifeaccordingtojimmy "LifeAccordingToJimmy") &#x2192; 2.5 mil)_
* Rebecca Black _([rebecca](https://www.youtube.com/user/rebecca "rebecca") &#x2192; 1.25 mil)_
* Jenn McAllister _([jennxpenn](https://www.youtube.com/user/jennxpenn "jennxpenn") &#x2192; 2.25 mil)_
* Arden Rose _([ARose186](https://www.youtube.com/user/ARose186 "rebecca")  &#x2192; 1.3 mil)_
