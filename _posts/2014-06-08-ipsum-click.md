In 2015 I had the absolute pleasure to be accepted to participate in Chicago's first [Comedy Hack Day](http://comedyhackday.com "Comedy Hack Day"), a hackathon started by [Cultivated Wit](http://www.cultivatedwit.com/ "Cultivated Wit") in SF. Built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, I was responsible for the UI & UX and partnered up for the HTML & CSS. By far one of the most incredible weekends of the year.
