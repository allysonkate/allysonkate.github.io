![Comedy Hack Day](/images/Ipsum1.png)


In 2015 I had the absolute pleasure to be accepted to participate in Chicago's first [Comedy Hack Day](http://comedyhackday.com "Comedy Hack Day"), a hackathon started by [Cultivated Wit](http://www.cultivatedwit.com/ "Cultivated Wit") in SF. By far one of the most incredible weekends of my year. I laughed and learned an incredible amount with our diverse group.

Our million dollar idea? Don't Read The Ipsum. We created a web app that generates artisan jumbled words based on Reddit threads, Twitter handles, and New York Times article searches, for a much more enjoyable Lorum Ipsum experience. I was responsible for the UI & UX and partnered up for the HTML & CSS. After presenting in front of a panel of judges, we ended up a finalist.
