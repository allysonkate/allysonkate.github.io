Since 2016 I've had the opportunity to design for Brainchild Studios and their small businesses clients doing branding, marketing design, and web design including the branding of the studio itself.

I was hired to create a versatile website template that could be repurposed for small business clients. I was tasked to create something that met common consumer requirements and allowed for a number of customizations and easy-to-edit page layouts. Since the launch it has been used and repurposed for a number of businesses and assisted in growing the Brainchild Studios clientele.
