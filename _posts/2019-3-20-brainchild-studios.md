Since 2016 I'v had the opportunity to design for Brainchild Studio and their small businesses clients doing branding, marketing design, and web design including the branding of the studio itself.

I was hired to create a versatile website template that could be repurposed for small business clients. I was tasked to create something that met common consumer requirements and allows for a number of customizations and easy-to-edit page layouts. Since the launch it has been used and repurposed for a number of businesses.
