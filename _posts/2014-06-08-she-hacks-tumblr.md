I had the privilage of attending an all female hackathon to get young girls interested in STEM... How rad is that.

My team's pitch?
An unitimidating playground that teaches young girls how to customize their Tumblr theme. (Also, pretty rad)

Tumblr remains the only widely used social platform that lets you customize the code, unlike 10 years ago when many of us learned by customizing Neopets or Myspace layouts.

The result? She Hacks Tumblr (luckily not known as: tumblher)

Built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, our team built a bare bones Tumblr theme using minimal code. I was responsible for the UI & UX and partnered up for the HTML &CSS.

Did you win, though? After 8 hours of coding, we presented in front of a team of judges and won the Quit Your Day Job Award. I can't say any of us have taken that literally yet.
