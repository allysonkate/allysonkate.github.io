In 2018 and 2019, I had the opportunity to concept, lead, and execute Solstice's annual emerging trends campaign highlighting the top tech trends across the globe. Touchpoints include videos, microsite, printed books, and hosted events. 2018 online downloads exceeded the entire previous year in just one week, and 2019 is on track to exceeded all goals.

<h3>The Second City Network</h3>

Along with the VP of New Media at The Second City, I became a point person for the communication of goals regarding the resign of the Network. The goal and challenge was to first and foremost educate the user about what the Second City Network is. I started researching client needs, user journeys, wireframing pages, helping with quality control and page speed, and discussing our user experience needs and information architecture with the contractor. In addition,  I helped rebrand the channel and created a variety of end cards to increase audience retention and engagement.

<h3>sctv.com</h3>

Our Toronto steakholders expressed the need for a product that showed off SCTV to potential clients interested in our SCTV archive. The goal was to showcase the history of SCTV Network, its actors, and the legacy the show and actors have left behind. I served as the lead creative director for the project and the sole designer and developer. Using an existing WordPress theme, I reworked the site with custom code to better fit the needs of the client.
