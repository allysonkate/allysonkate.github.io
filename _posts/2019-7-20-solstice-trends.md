Since 2017, I've had the opportunity to build and lead the global design team for brand & marketing at Solstice, a digital innovation firm that helps Fortune 500 companies seize new opportunities through digital solutions.

<h3>Creative Direction, Marketing, Visual & Experiential Design</h3>

In 2018 and 2019, I had the opportunity to concept, lead, and execute Solstice's annual emerging trends campaign highlighting the top tech trends across the globe. Touchpoints include videos, microsite, printed books, and hosted events. 2018 online downloads exceeded the entire previous year in just one week, and 2019 is on track to exceeded all goals.

<h3>SolsticeFWD Conference</h3>

FWD is an interactive summit with revealing explorations of bold, innovative ideas and immersive, emerging tech experiences designed for forward-thinking executives. I've led both digital and physical brand and design experiences for both Chicago and New York FWD conferences.

<h3>sctv.com</h3>

Our Toronto steakholders expressed the need for a product that showed off SCTV to potential clients interested in our SCTV archive. The goal was to showcase the history of SCTV Network, its actors, and the legacy the show and actors have left behind. I served as the lead creative director for the project and the sole designer and developer. Using an existing WordPress theme, I reworked the site with custom code to better fit the needs of the client.
