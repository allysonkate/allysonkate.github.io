Since 2017, I've had the opportunity to build and lead the global design team for brand & marketing at Solstice, a digital innovation firm that helps Fortune 500 companies seize new opportunities through digital solutions.

<h3>Creative Direction, Marketing, Visual & Experiential Design</h3>

In 2018 and 2019, I had the opportunity to concept, lead, and execute Solstice's annual emerging trends campaign highlighting the top tech trends across the globe. Touchpoints include videos, microsite, printed books, and hosted events. 2018 online downloads exceeded the entire previous year in just one week, and 2019 is on track to exceeded all goals.

<h3>SolsticeFWD Conference</h3>

FWD is an interactive summit with revealing explorations of bold, innovative ideas and immersive, emerging tech experiences designed for forward-thinking executives. I've led both digital and physical brand and design experiences for both Chicago and New York FWD conferences. More coming soon, see last years recap [here](https://youtu.be/9a238zN2ioo).

Under the SolsticeFWD also lives our thought leadership platform, which houses our blogs, podcast, whitepapers, and press. The old page was outdated and nearly impossible to digest from a UX perspective. In 2018 I led a redesign of the content hub from the ground up including strategy, user flow, hierarchy, wireframes, UI & visual design.
