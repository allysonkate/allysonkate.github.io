In January of 2014, I was hired at [The Second City](http://www.secondcity.com/), a world-renowned comedy club, theatre and school of improvisation,  as a design intern. Since then, I have grown from intern to Jr. Designer, and Jr. Designer to Designer on a team of five.  As part of a small design team in a multifaceted company, I've been able to have a hand in almost every department across the globe and cater my position to areas I've seen need, potential, and had personal interest with both internal and external clients. A few of my favorite projects and products are discussed below.

<h3>Brand, Marketing & Art Direction</h3>

I was fortunate enough to have a hand in shaping a major rebrand across all branches of the company. One of my primary roles on the team is as the lead designer of the general second city brand and stages for both Chicago and Toronto. Under this role I have collaborated with our marketing team to develop and execute several brand awareness and show campaigns for various target audiences. In-depth campaigns upon request.

<h3>sctv.com</h3>

Our theater in Toronto expressed the need for a product that showed off SCTV to potential clients interested in our SCTV archive. The goal was to showcase the history of SCTV Network, its actors, and the legacy the show and actors have left behind. I served as the lead creative director for the project and the sole designer and developer. Using an existing WordPress theme, I reworked the site with custom code to better fit the needs of the client.

<h3>secondcity.com</h3>

As I grew within the company, I showed interest in the redesign of the website on WordPress, a project that had been contracted out before I was hired. I saw a great need for project management, UX knowledge, and communication within our company regarding this redesign. Along with the VP of New Media at The Second City, I became a point person for the project. I started researching client needs, user journeys, wireframing pages, helping with quality control and page speed, and discussing our user experience needs and information architecture with the contractor. Featured above are a few of the pages I had a hand in redesigning.

<h3>The Second City Network</h3>

Another project I expressed early interest in was our YouTube channel, SecondCityNetwork. I helped rebrand the channel and created a variety of end cards to increase audience retention and engagement.
