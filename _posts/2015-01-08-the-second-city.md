In January of 2014, I was hired at The Second City, a world-renowned comedy club, theatre and school of improvisation,  as an in-house design intern. Since then, I have grown from intern, to Jr. Designer, to Designer, to my current title, Sr. Designer on a team of 5.  As part of a small design team in a multi-fasicted company, I've been able to have a hand in almost every department across the globe and cater my position to areas I've seen need, potential, and had personal interest. A few of my favorite projects and products are discussed below.

As a grew within the company, I showed interest in the redesign of the website on Wordpress, a project that had been contracted out before I was hired. I saw a great need for project management, UX knowledge, and communication within our company regarding this redesign. Along with the VP of New Media at The Second City, I became a point person for the project. I started researching client needs, wireframing pages, helping with quality control & page speed, and discussing our user experience needs and information architecture with the contractor. Featured above are a few of the pages I hand in redesigning.
