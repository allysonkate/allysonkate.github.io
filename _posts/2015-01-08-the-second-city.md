In January of 2014, I was hired at [The Second City](http://secondcity.com), a world-renowned comedy club, theatre and school of improvisation,  as an in-house design intern. Since then, I have grown from intern, to Jr. Designer, to Designer on a team of 5.  As part of a small design team in a multi-fasicted company, I've been able to have a hand in almost every department across the globe and cater my position to areas I've seen need, potential, and had personal interest. A few of my favorite projects and products are discussed below.

Our theater in Toronto expressed the need for a product that showed off SCTV to potential clients interested in our SCTV archive. The goal was to showcase the history of SCTV Network, the actors, and the legacy the show and actors have left behind. I served as the lead creative director for the project and and sole designer and developer. Using an existing Wordpress theme, I reworked the site with custom code to better fit the needs of the client.

As a grew within the company, I showed interest in the redesign of the website on Wordpress, a project that had been contracted out before I was hired. I saw a great need for project management, UX knowledge, and communication within our company regarding this redesign. Along with the VP of New Media at The Second City, I became a point person for the project. I started researching client needs, wireframing pages, helping with quality control & page speed, and discussing our user experience needs and information architecture with the contractor. Featured above are a few of the pages I hand in redesigning.

Another project I expressed early interest in was our YouTube channel, SecondCityNetwork. I helped rebrand the channel and create a variety of end cards to increase audience retention and engagement.
