I haven't made a video in well over a year now, I never had an audience big enough for any real notice, and what YouTube has become is so much different than the small community that got me interested in it in 2007. 

I still consider myself a YouTuber, several of my closest friends originated from my YouTube friendships, and YouTube provided/aided in most if not all of my design jobs since then (not to mention couches all over the world.)

So, I'm still asking myself the same question I was in 2007, "What does YouTube mean to me?"

The YouTube community was and is home. This remains.

Algorithms, fangirls, brand sponsorships aside, there remains many small but mighty YouTube communities out of the spotlight. The ones using it as a creative outlet or a platform for dicussion, that's where the true value lies. Money? Maybe not. But authentic relatonships and meaningful discussion? Absolutely. That's what YouTube meant to me. That's where my passion lies: in the cultivation and preservation of those communities.
