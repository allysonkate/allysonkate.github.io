There's one thing I've known about myself ever since I was introduced to the internet itself, and that's how important online communities are to me. If you tried to visualize that, it would resemble an embarrassing, emotional overlapping timeline from everything from Neopets, YA novel forums, to (a much more mature?) YouTube and Twitter. Each had me just as passionate and committed as the last.

While many of these communities still hold true in my daily life, the recent entrance of one in 2015 has fueled me in so many ways that I simply must speak on the value it of my life.

>The beauty of Slack for me lies in the diversity in content, community, and discussion that you have the opportunity to be welcome and a part of, regardless of your status.

I belong to a Slack community about the future of podcasting, web friends in Chicago, UX designers, and women with careers in product. The talent and intellegence I'm surrounded everyday within the Slack communities is incredible, humbling, and one of the purest forms of positive online communities today.
