  <p><em><img src="/images/YouTube_Screenshot.jpg" alt="Youtube Self" /></em></p>

<p>When asked about my involvement with YouTube, I always seem to begin with “Well, it started as a hobby…” In high school I would come home from school and watch my favorite vloggers on YouTube. In 2016, this sounds relatively commonplace. In 2007, this wasn’t something you said to people without accepting the fact that you would have to explain what you just said for a good five minutes and still be met with confusion and sarcastic comments.</p>

<p>Through the years, I watched these people grow up, go through struggles, start college, get into relationships and ultimately regret talking telling the internet about their relationships. No production value concerns, no brand sponsorships, no such thing as “YouTube Stars.” I was extremely passionate about YouTube as a online community platform, and I wanted in. These people understood me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 2007 YouTube was something special, and I was quickly becoming an introvert IRL simply because no one could understand what the hell I was passionate about.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Video responses were the heart and soul of the community, so that’s usually how you got your in. People could put a face to a username. From there, it kind of just snowballed. We were just friends with a cool thing in common. Soon my Friday nights were spent on BlogTV streams and skype was a daily fixture in my life. Gifs starting happening. I was doing collabs left and right. In 2013 I asked people to post a 10 second video giving a pun, calling it “Pun Run 2k13.” There were 40 video responses. I signed with multi-channel network, Big Frame, for two years before I slowly made making videos much less of a priority and decided I wasn’t going to play the YouTube algorithm game.</p>

<hr />

<p>It’s 2016 and things are insanely different. Insanely different. But that’s okay. To be living through a period of time where we can reflect and watch the rise and fall of online communities, social platforms, and brand adoption… that’s cool as heck.</p>

<p>I haven’t made a video in well over a year now, but I still consider myself a YouTuber. I still go to Anaheim for VidCon, the YouTube convention John and Hank Green started in 2010. Several of my closest friends originated from my YouTube friendships and YouTube provided/aided in most if not all of my design jobs since then (not to mention couches all over the world.) Algorithms, fangirls, brand sponsorships aside, there remains many small but mighty YouTube communities out of the spotlight. The ones using it as a creative outlet or a platform for discussion, that’s where the true value lies. Is there money there? Maybe not. But authentic relationships and meaningful discussion? Absolutely. That’s what YouTube meant to me. That’s where my passion lies: in the cultivation and preservation of those communities. I’d love to talk your ear off about it over coffee.</p>

<p><em><img src="/images/NerdCon_2015_001.jpg" alt="NerdCon" /></em></p>

<p>So, I’m still asking myself the same question I was in 2007, “What does YouTube mean to me?”</p>

<p>The YouTube community was and is home. I have a feeling this will always remain.</p>
