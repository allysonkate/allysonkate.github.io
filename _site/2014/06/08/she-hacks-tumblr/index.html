<p>I had the privilege of attending an all female hackathon at Cleverbridge in Chicago to get young girls interested in STEM. My group set out to build an unitimidating playground that teaches young girls how to customize their Tumblr theme.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tumblr remains the only widely used social platform that lets you customize the code, unlike years ago when many of us became familiar with code by customizing Neopets or Myspace layouts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And there it was. We had our passion product. We were going to build not just a tutorial, but a Tumblr playground. A low-steaks environment to learn, mess up, add personality, and instantly see the effects of <em>your</em> code on <em>your</em> site.</p>

<p>Thanks to the generous social reach of one of our group members, we were able to do some quick field research regarding interest in the product and features they‚Äôd like to see.</p>

<h4 id="together-we-spent-our-saturday-creating-she-hacks-tumblr">Together, we spent our Saturday creating She Hacks Tumblr.</h4>

<p>Built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, our team built a bare bones Tumblr theme using minimal code. I was responsible for the UI &amp; UX and partnered up for the HTML &amp; CSS. The biggest challenge during any hackathon is always time, but we were able to develop the first few tutorial steps and push live for the demo on <a href="http://shehacks.tumblr.com/" title="She Hacks Tumblr">shehacks.tumblr.com</a>.</p>
