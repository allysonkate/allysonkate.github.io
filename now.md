Currently, I'm:  

* Freelancing with [Spirits](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/spirits-drunken-dive-into/id1080871005?mt=2): a boozy biweekly podcast about mythology, legends and lore. Enjoying panel talks and further podcast development with the Spirits team.

* Working on a mixed media side-project that exploits your early online presence. 

* Doing my part to keep the internet [weird](http://tinyletter.com/allysonkate/).

* Reading [Magic and Loss](https://www.amazon.com/Magic-Loss-Internet-as-Art/dp/1439191700)
