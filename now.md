Currently, I'm:  

* Freelancing with [Spirits](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/spirits-drunken-dive-into/id1080871005?mt=2) a boozy biweekly podcast about mythology, legends and lore, and looking forward to co-leading a podcast workshop in Boston this winter.

* Producing a revamping for the ol' YouTube channel.

* Reading [Product Design for the Web](https://www.amazon.com/Product-Design-Web-Principles-Designing/dp/0321929039) and [Creativity, Inc.](https://www.amazon.com/Creativity-Inc-Overcoming-Unseen-Inspiration/dp/0812993012)
